Victim: Dr. Leena Ramaswamy
Age: 54
Occupation: World-renowned botanist
Time of Death: Estimated between 7:30 PM – 7:40 PM, during the Orchid Gala

Cause of Death:
Despite signs of blunt force trauma, toxicological analysis confirmed that the actual cause of death was poisoning. A rare, fast-acting botanical toxin—derived from an orchid strain labeled “Specimen T-26”—was found in the victim's bloodstream.

Toxic Substance:
-- Toxin extracted from a highly toxic orchid species engineered by the victim for research purposes.
-- Trace residue was found in a shattered glass vial near the body, matching those kept in Dr. Ramaswamy’s secured research cabinet.

Body Examination:
-- Blunt force injuries (bruising on the left shoulder and back of the head) are post-mortem, likely sustained when the bronze orchid statue was tipped over after death.
-- No defensive wounds or external lacerations.

Other Key Evidence:
-- No fingerprints on the statue or broken vial—both were wiped clean.
-- Bootprints found at the scene match security-issue footwear, standard only for on-duty personnel.
