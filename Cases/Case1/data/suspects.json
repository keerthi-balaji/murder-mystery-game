    "details": "Renowned botanist and academic rival of Dr. Ramaswamy. She’s the kind of woman who never forgets a slight — even one she imagined. Whispers say she once published a rebuttal just to sabotage Leena’s grant. Flowers aren’t the only things she’s dissected."

    "name": "Mr. Kiran Rao",

    "details": "Former research assistant to Dr. Ramaswamy. He left her lab under murky circumstances and now lingers around the research wing like a ghost with unfinished business. He avoids tight spaces — the Dome makes his skin crawl. One too many unanswered emails can break a man."

    "name": "Madame Eloise Mercier",
    "image": "/images/eloise.png",
    "details": "High-profile orchid investor and longtime patron of the Gardens. Elegance hides many thorns. She bankrolls endangered orchids and expects them to bloom on command. Leena refused to monetize beauty. Eloise? She refused to take no for an answer."

    "name": "Sir Felix Duval",
    "image": "/images/felix.png",
    "details": "Head of security at Solstice Botanical Gardens. Seen and unseen, loyal and alone. They say he knew every corner of the Dome — and maybe, every corner of her heart. Some say duty kept him close. Others wonder what he was protecting."
