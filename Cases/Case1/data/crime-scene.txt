The Orchid Dome was bathed in golden evening light when Dr. Leena Ramaswamy’s body was discovered. This opulent glass structure—home to hundreds of rare orchids and lush tropical flora—was the centerpiece of the Orchid Gala.

At the center of the dome, nestled between decorative stone planters, Dr. Ramaswamy lay motionless, her body partially obscured by a toppled bronze statue of an orchid in bloom. Initially, it appeared she had been struck by the statue, which was heavy enough to cause fatal injury. However, something didn’t add up.

Near the body, investigators found:
-- A broken glass vial, its label smudged but readable: Specimen T-26 – Toxic Orchid Extract.
-- A pair of muddy boot prints, traced to standard-issue security footwear.
-- A slight bruise pattern inconsistent with the statue’s impact.
-- No signs of a struggle, but a strong chemical scent lingered in the air.
