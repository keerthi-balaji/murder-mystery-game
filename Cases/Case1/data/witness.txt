** Witness 1 — Retired Orchid Society Member **

“I remember hearing that one of Leena’s old protégés never really got over being dismissed from her lab. You know the type — ambitious, a little unhinged. There was talk they blamed her for ruining their career. When people stew in that kind of resentment long enough… well, who knows what they’re capable of.”


** Witness 2 — Gala PR Coordinator **

“That big-shot investor? I overheard them arguing with Dr. Ramaswamy during planning — something about orchid patents and exclusive rights. Leena wouldn’t budge. She didn’t care about profit, which didn’t sit well with the donor crowd. She was costing them millions by refusing a partnership.”


** Witness 3 — Visiting Professor from Oslo **

“The other botanist — the one with the fancy credentials — was always bitter that Leena got more press. I was at a panel last year where she accused Leena of hoarding samples. Called her a gatekeeper. It sounded like science, but it felt personal. Professional jealousy has ruined more careers than you’d think.”


** Witness 4 — Security Trainee **

“Chief Duval? He used to walk Dr. Ramaswamy home after late lab sessions. People said they were close, but I think something changed recently. He was… tense. I even saw him snap at her once, just under his breath. When personal things go south and you’re still forced to see each other every day... that’s awkward.”
