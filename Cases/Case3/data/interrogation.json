    "statement": "“Our museum’s ‘donation partnership’ program is legitimate. Reporters love to twist ‘loan agreements’ into something scandalous. I don’t know the tunnels, though—why would I? Dust on my cuffs? Stage storage is filthy this time of year.”"

    "statement": "“Keys are constantly checked out. I let Hale’s team handle a hatch earlier; it came back… I think after 21:30? People borrow, return, borrow again. If something went wrong, it’s because procedures were ignored—by someone else.”"

    "statement": "“Rope for a rig rehearsal, standard. If it smelled like grease, that’s from the winch in the rigging bay. Hale’s ‘consulting’ payments? Tiny stipends. This festival runs on side gigs.”"
