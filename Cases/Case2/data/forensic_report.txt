**Crime Scene Observations**

Upon entering Server Room 6 (Level 3 – Restricted Zone) at Neuronexus HQ, the body of Dr. Elina Rao was found slumped forward at Terminal A12. The lighting in the room was dimmed, and the terminal displayed a diagnostic interface in progress. No signs of forced entry or struggle were observed. A faint burn mark was present on the metal keyboard edge, and the air carried a detectable ozone odor, often associated with electrical discharge.
A tool access panel behind the server rack was ajar, and scorch marks were observed on an internal grounding conduit. The victim was dressed in a standard lab coat, which showed no tearing; however, a small scorch hole was noted on the right glove.

**Autopsy Results**

Dr. Elina Rao, age 37, was pronounced deceased at the scene. The estimated time of death was between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM on April 14, 2013. External examination revealed a contact burn wound on the palm of the right hand and an exit wound on the left foot arch, consistent with electrical grounding. Minor singeing was observed around the temples.

There were no signs of blunt force trauma or defensive injuries. Internally, the heart showed scarring consistent with a high-voltage shock. The pupils were fixed and dilated, and neural shutdown markers were present.
